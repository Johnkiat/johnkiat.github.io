I'm currently not particularly active in this area right now, but my adventures in neuroscience research started out here, and I'm proud of the work I did back when!
<br/><br/>
So, this may or may not be a surprise to you, but it turns out we humans have pretty imperfect memories. A particularly interesting phenomenon in this area is the fact that we can come to believe in false memories of things that never actually happened. Naturally, this has super important implications for situations involving crimes and is also really useful in shedding light on how memory works in the brain. 
<br/><br/>
The main question Bob (Belli) and I worked together towards answering back when was (1) are there are individual differences in susceptibility to false memories? and (2) can we differentiate between real and false memories after they've been formed? These are tough questions to answer well, given how challenging it is to obtain reliable measures of false memory susceptibility, but we did achieve some success in this area.
<br/><br/>
One of the cool things we pulled off was the first EEG study of false event memory for reenacted crime events (a paradigm known as the misinformation effect). In this study, we found that we could distinguish between true and false memories a day after they had been formed by looking at aspects of the neural signal related to the memory trace's strength and the amount of attention oriented toward the presented retrieval cue (i.e., the test question they were being asked).

<br/>
Building on the attention finding, we then went on to see if we could predict which individuals would be susceptible to forming false memories using their brain activity on an attention task known as the oddball paradigm.

<br/><br/>
This actually worked, and we found that we could account for about 24% of individual variability in false memory formation with this approach. Ultimately, while it is very difficult to obtain valid, reliable measures of false memory susceptibility for event memories to do this sort of research, it's an important area of work that has significant real-world implications.
