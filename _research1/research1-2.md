I'm currently not particularly active in this area these days, but my adventures in neuroscience research started out here, and I'm proud of the work I did back when!
<br/><br/>
So, this may or may not be a surprise to you, depending on your background, but it turns out we humans have pretty imperfect memories. A particularly interesting phenomenon in this area is the fact that we can come to believe in false memories of things that never actually happened. Naturally, this has super important implications for situations involving crimes and is also really useful in shedding light on how memory works in the brain. 
<br/><br/>
The main question Bob (Belli) and I were interested in answering back then was whether there are individual differences in susceptibility to false memories and whether we can differentiate between real and false memories after they've been formed. These are difficult questions to answer well given how challenging it is to obtain reliable measures of false memory susptibility, but we did achieve some success in this area.
<br/><br/>
One of the cool things we pulled off was the first EEG study of false event memory for reenacted crimes (a task known as the misinformation effect paradigm). In this study we found that we could indeed distinguish between true and false memories a day after they had been formed by looking at aspects of the neural signal related to the strength of the memory trace as well as the amount of attention oriented towards the presented retrieval cue.

<br/>
Building on the attention finding, we then went on to see if we could predict which individuals would be susceptible to forming false memories by linking brain activity on a classic attention task known as the oddball paradigm to susceptibility to false memory formation on the misinformation paradigm.

<br/><br/>
This actually worked, and we found that we could account for about 24% of individual variability in false memory formation with this approach. Ultimately, while it is very difficult to obtain valid reliable measures of false memory susceptibility for event memories, it's an important area of work that has significant real-world implications.
