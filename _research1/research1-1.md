How do we perceive the world around us? A seemingly simple question that gets devilishly hard the deeper one dives into it. It's really mindblowing how much work our central nervous system does (not just in the brain but also in the eye itself!) to turn those incoming photons into dogs, cats, trees, and loved ones.

<br/><br/>
My work in this area focuses on a few fundamental questions in this domain.
<br/><br/>
1) What is the time course of visual processing and attention?
<br/><br/>
Everything we see is made up of visual features. These range from simple things like lines and colors to more complicated things like textures, contours and so on. One of the things I'm interested in understanding is how quickly our brains can begin to process these features in real-world scenes. For example, in one of my papers, I looked at the difference between how long it took for the brain to process simple visual features (i.e., Saliency) in real-world scenes versus more complicated ones that were more closely related to understanding what things "are" (i.e., "Meaning" or semantic informativeness).

<br/><br/>
To do this, we recorded electrical activity from the brain while subjects looked at real-world scenes and used modeling techniques to figure out at what point in time information predictive of each type of feature began to emerge in the neural signal. It turned out to be a pretty close race! Saliency-related information emerged about 78 milliseconds after viewing a scene, with meaning-related information emerging a mere 9 milliseconds later.

2) How can we best model how the brain represents complex visual information?
<br/><br/>
Speaking of complex visual features. Another interesting question is how our brains represent complex real-world scenes. Naturally there have been hundreds if not thousands of studies looking 
<br/><br/>
3) How are 1 & 2 impacted by individual traits and state-level differences?
